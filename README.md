# unpalindromer

*Adapted from the original challenge proposed by Landing Jobs @ Landing Fest 2019.*

Objective: 
- Turn palindrome input into not palindrome by changing one single character.

Has to pass these tests:
- Accepts only strings of 1-1000 characters
- Converts to and return string in lower case
- Turns palindrome into not palindrome

Note:
- Original challenge only inputs palindromes so there was no need to check that condition. Still, I decided on adding it anyway.
- Input is presumed alphanumeric. I chose to remove any symbol character just in case.
